# RustPlusApi

## üìä Features

This is a list of some of the features that the RustPlusApi provides:

- `GetEntityInfo` Get current state of a Smart Device
- `GetInfo` Get info about the Rust Server
- `GetMap` Fetch map info, which inclues a jpg image
- `GetMapMarkers` Get map markers
- `GetTeamInfo` Get list of team members and positions on map
- `GetTime` Get the current in game time
- `SendTeamMessage` Send messages to Team Chat
- `SetEntityValue` Set the value of a Smart Device

Feel free to **explore** the `./RustPlusApi/Examples/` folder to see how to **use** the API.

## üñäÔ∏è Versions 

![skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cs,dotnet)

- [.NET 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8) or later

## üìö Sumary

- [RustPlusLegacy](#RustPlusLegacy)
- [RustPlus](#RustPlus)
- [RustPlusListener](#RustPlusListener)

The library provides three classes to interact with the Rust+ API: `RustPlusLegacy`, `RustPlus` & `RustPlusListener`.

- `RustPlusLegacy` is the original implementation based on the `./Protobuf/RustPlus.proto` file.
- `RustPlus` is a new implementation that return a response based on `./Data/Response.cs` object.

Since `RustPlus` inherit from `RustPlusLegacy`, you can use both classes to interact with the Rust+ API. The `RustPlus` class is recommended for new projects, as it provides a more user-friendly interface and better error handling.

- `RustPlusListener` is a class to listen to the FCM socket and handle notifications.

## üìç NuGet

Simply use this library in your project by running the following commands:

```dotnet
dotnet add package RustPlusApi
```

```dotnet
dotnet add package RustPlusApi.Fcm
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### RustPlusApi

<details><summary> RustPlusLegacy </summary>

First, instantiate the `RustPlusLegacy` class with the necessary parameters:

```csharp
var rustPlusApi = new RustPlusLegacy(server, port, playerId, playerToken, useFacepunchProxy);
```

Parameters:

- `server`: The IP address of the Rust+ server.
- `port`: The port dedicated for the Rust+ companion app (not the one used to connect in-game).
- `playerId`: Your Steam ID.
- `playerToken`: Your player token acquired with FCM.
- `useFacepunchProxy`: Specifies whether to use the Facepunch proxy. Default is false.

Then, connect to the Rust+ server:

```csharp
await rustPlusApi.ConnectAsync();
```

---

There are plenty of methods to interact with the Rust+ server such as:

```csharp
uint entityId = 123456789;
var response = await rustPlus.GetEntityInfoLegacyAsync(entityId);
```
or
```csharp
var response = await rustPlus.GetInfoLegacyAsync();
```
you can also make your own request:

```csharp
var request = new AppRequest
{
    GetTime = new AppEmpty()
};
await rustPlus.SendRequestAsync(request);
```


The response with be an **AppMessage** that is a direct representation of `./Protobuf/RustPlus.proto` file.

Feel free to explore the `RustPlusLegacy` class to find all convinient methods to use.

---

You can subscribe to events to handle specific actions:

```csharp
rustPlusApi.Connecting += (sender, _) => { /* handle connecting event */ };
rustPlusApi.Connected += (sender, _) => { /* handle connected event */ };

rustPlusApi.MessageReceived += (sender, message) => { /* handle every message receive from the socket */ };
rustPlusApi.NotificationReceived += (sender, message) => { /* handle every notification (no direct request) from the socket */ };
rustPlusApi.ResponseReceived += (sender, message) => { /* handle every response (answer to a request) from the socket */ };

rustPlusApi.Disconnecting += (sender, _) => { /* handle disconnecting event */ };
rustPlusApi.Disconnected += (sender, _) => { /* handle disconnected event */ };

rustPlusApi.ErrorOccurred += (sender, ex) => { /* handle error event */ };
```

--- 

Remember to dispose the `RustPlusLegacy` instance when you're done:

```csharp
rustPlusApi.DisconnectAsync(); 
```
</details>

---

<details><summary> RustPlus </summary>

The `RustPlus` classe inherit from `RustPlusLegacy` and provide a more user-friendly interface to interact with the Rust+ API.	That means you can use all methods from `RustPlusLegacy` and also the new ones from `RustPlus`.

Such as the `RustPlusLegacy`, you need to instantiate the `RustPlus` class with the necessary parameters:

```csharp
var rustPlusApi = new RustPlus(server, port, playerId, playerToken, useFacepunchProxy);
```

---

There are quite the same methods as `RustPlusLegacy` but the response is a direct representation of `./Data/Response.cs` object.

```csharp
public class Response<T>
{
    public bool IsSuccess { get; set; }
    public Error? Error { get; set; }
    public T? Data { get; set; }
}

public class Error
{
    public string? Message { get; set; }
}
```

For example, to get the entity info:

```csharp
uint smartSwitchId = 123456789;
var response = await rustPlus.GetSmartSwitchInfoAsync(smartSwitchId);
```

Response will be a `Response<SmartSwitchInfo>` object.

```csharp
public class SmartSwitchInfo
{
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }
}
```

---

You can olso subscribe to more events to handle specific actions:

```csharp
rustPlusApi.OnSmartSwitchTriggered += (sender, smartSwitch) => { /* handle smart switch triggered event */ };
rustPlusApi.OnStorageMonitorTriggered += (sender, storageMonitor) => { /* handle storage monitor triggered event */ };

rustPlusApi.OnTeamChatReceived += (sender, message) => { /* handle team chat received event */ };
```

To be able to receive theses events, you need to previously make a request on the given entity or chat.

For example, to receive the smart switch triggered event, you need to make a request on the smart switch entity:

```csharp
rustPlus.OnSmartSwitchTriggered += (_, message) =>
{
    // ...
};

const uint entityId = 123456789;
var message = await rustPlus.GetSmartSwitchInfoAsync(entityId);
```

Each time the smart switch is triggered, the event will be fired.

---

Remember to dispose the `RustPlus` instance when you're done (such as `RustPlusLegacy`):

```csharp
rustPlusApi.DisconnectAsync(); 
```
</details>

---

### RustPlusApi.Fcm

<details><summary> RustPlusListener </summary>

First, instantiate the `FcmListener` class with the necessary parameters:

```csharp
var fcmListener = new FcmListener(credentials, persistentIds);
```

Parameters:

- `credentials`: The `Credentials`\* object containing the FCM & GCM credentials + the keys to decrypt the notification.
- `persistentIds`: A list of notification IDs that should be ignored. Default is null.

\* Go to the [Credentials](#credentials) section to know how to get it.

Then, connect to the FCM socket:

```csharp
await fcmListener.ConnectAsync();
```

You can subscribe to events to handle connection, disconnection, errors, and received messages:

```csharp
fcmListener.Connecting += (sender, e) => { /* handle connecting event */ };
fcmListener.Connected += (sender, e) => { /* handle connected event */ };
fcmListener.Disconnected += (sender, e) => { /* handle disconnected event */ };
fcmListener.ErrorOccurred += (sender, e) => { /* handle error event */ };
fcmListener.MessageReceived += (sender, e) => { /* handle received message event */ };
```

Remember to dispose the `FcmListener` instance when you're done:

```csharp
fcmListener.Dispose(); 
```
</details>

## Credentials

Currenlty, there is not simple way to get the FCM & GCM credentials using **.NET**.
I've planned to implement a solution but it's not ready yet.

To use this library, you need to get the FCM & GCM credentials manually.
To do so I recommand you to use [this project](https://github.com/liamcottle/rustplus.js) to get the credentials.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience but since the API is not fully complete it's the easiest way.
